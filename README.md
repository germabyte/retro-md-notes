# Retro MD Notes – README

This project hosts a collection of `.md` (Markdown) notes on a **static** page (`index.html`) with **client-side search** and **pagination**, all styled in a retro green-on-black theme.  
The site uses a **Python** script to build a `db.json` file, which serves as the data source for the front-end.

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
This project is a personal project, and I work on it whenever I feel like it. The information in this README might not always reflect the current state of the code or functionality. While I’ve documented the workflow and structure as accurately as possible, I don’t guarantee I’ll update the README in the future, even if the program evolves. Please explore the code yourself if something seems unclear or out of date.

## 1. Project Structure

```
.
├─ index.html         # Main entry point, displays search UI and note links
├─ db.json            # Auto-generated JSON of all MD notes (filename + content)
├─ notes/             # Folder containing all .md files
│   ├─ note1.md
│   ├─ note2.md
│   └─ ...
└─ update_db.py       # Python script (with GUI or CLI) to build/refresh db.json
```

### `index.html`
- The single-page app that **fetches** `db.json` and shows notes in a retro UI.  
- Allows searching filenames & note contents, and paginates results.  
- Clicking on a note link opens the **raw `.md`** in a new tab.

### `db.json`
- Generated by `update_db.py`.  
- Contains an array of objects, each with at least:
  ```json
  {
    "filename": "note1.md",
    "content": "...full content of note..."
  }
  ```

### `notes/`
- All your Markdown files go here.  
- Subfolder structure is optional, but in the simplest approach, keep all notes directly under `notes/`.

### `update_db.py`
- Python script that scans `notes/`, reads `.md` files, and writes an updated `db.json`.  
- May provide a **Tkinter GUI** or a CLI.  
- Run it **every time** you add, edit, or remove `.md` files in `notes/`.

## 2. Workflow

1. **Add / Edit Notes**
   - Place new `.md` files inside the `notes/` folder.  
   - If you remove or rename a file, do so in `notes/` as well.

2. **Run `update_db.py`**
   - This script scans all `.md` files under `notes/` and generates (or overwrites) `db.json`.  
   - **Example** (CLI):  
     ```bash
     python update_db.py
     ```  
   - If using a Tkinter GUI version, you might simply double-click `update_db.py` (on Windows) or run `python update_db.py`, then click “Build/Update DB” in the GUI window.  
   - On success, a message will show how many notes were processed.

3. **Test Locally (Optional)**
   - You can test the site locally using a simple HTTP server (because `fetch` often fails via `file://`). For instance:  
     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```  
   - Then visit <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.  
   - Check that the search and pagination work, and that new or edited notes appear as expected.

4. **Deploy / Upload**
   - Upload (or commit/push) **all** of the following to your static host (Altervista, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.):
     - `index.html`  
     - `db.json` (just regenerated)  
     - The entire `notes/` folder  
   - Once deployed, open the site in your browser to confirm everything looks good.

## 3. Hosting Notes

- Because this project uses **purely static** files, you can host it on:  
  - **Altervista**  
  - **GitHub Pages**  
  - **Netlify**  
  - **Any** static hosting provider  
- Just make sure `index.html`, `db.json`, and `notes/` are served at the **same level** so that `index.html` can find `db.json` and `notes/`.

## 4. Tips & Customizations

1. **Title Extraction** (Optional)  
   - You could parse the first line of each `.md` file as the “title” rather than using the filename. That would require a small tweak in `update_db.py` and `index.html`.

2. **Search Performance**  
   - For **hundreds** of notes, the current approach is usually fine. If you have **thousands** of large `.md` files, consider partial indexing (storing only the first few kilobytes in `db.json`) or more advanced optimizations.

3. **Look & Feel**  
   - The retro theme is purely in the CSS. Feel free to customize the layout, hover effects, ASCII borders, or color scheme while keeping the same static + JSON approach.

4. **Version Control**  
   - If you use Git, commit both your `update_db.py` script and `notes/` folder, but **maybe** add `db.json` to `.gitignore` if you prefer it to always be regenerated. Or keep it versioned if you want to track changes.

## 5. FAQ

**Q: Why do I need `update_db.py`?**  
**A:** Because we’re using a static website with no server-side logic. The script “pre-builds” an index (`db.json`) of notes so that `index.html` can fetch and render them.

**Q: Can I rename `notes/` to something else?**  
**A:** Yes. Just be sure to update any references in `update_db.py` and `index.html` (the link `notes/${note.filename}`) to match.

**Q: Why does the search not work in Chrome when I just open `index.html` from my file system?**  
**A:** For security reasons, browsers often block `fetch` from local files. Use a minimal server like `python -m http.server` or upload to a static hosting service.

## 6. Summary

1. **Update `notes/`** with your Markdown files.  
2. **Run `update_db.py`** to rebuild `db.json`.  
3. **Test Locally** with a local server.  
4. **Deploy** all files to your static host.  

**Enjoy** your retro green-on-black markdown index with client-side search!
